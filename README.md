## The Problem
Managing a business is difficult. There are many parts of running a successful business from operations to finances and sales and what success looks like in each part is different. There is a lot of context switching and figuring out what the problems and bottlenecks are in a business. Some businesses operate like a tangled mess and owners dont know where to start. There are lots of repetitive processes, for each customers order, which is tedious and leads to careless mistakes. Additionally it is difficult remembering all the details about each order as well as updates made throughout.

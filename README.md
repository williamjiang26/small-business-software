## The Problem
Managing a business is difficult. You have to develop your product and service which is the niche of your business and what the customer directly interacts with. Behind the scenes, you have to develop business operations, the sales and marketing. You have to manage finances, payroll and compliance. There are many parts to running a successful business and what success looks like in each part is different. Some businesses operate like a tangled mess and owners dont know where to start. There is a lot of context switching and figuring out what the problems and bottlenecks are in a business. I am building an all in one software for home improvement businesses.


## The Sub Problem
I started by tackling operations. I think successful operations, gives way to all the other stuff. If you have a well-defined process, you can figure out where you went wrong and adjust. I built an order management dashboard to manage and streamline the customer order process from creating the order to its fulfillment. 

Managing orders is challenging. There are lots of repetitive processes for each customer's order, which is tedious to do and leads to careless mistakes when you are dealing with multiple orders. Additionally it is difficult to remember all the details about each order as well as changes made by the customer throughout the its fulfillment without software allowing you to filter to find orders fast and store all the order's details. 

## Jobs to be done
- update customer order details, track status of customer orders, store customer info
- organize products in inventory, product location, types and sizes, stock levels, re-stocking info
- store customer cases, make updates to their order
